Search @ Culpur.net is a highly customized privacy enhanced metasearch engine with a SearXNG backend.

Our metasearch engine aggregates the results of other search engines while not storing information about its users. Each search is conducted with a unique persona and token, obfuscating user activity, and making it impossible for major search engines to collect your data or track your forward activities.

Why use it?

Because you are not a commodity to be sold. Your data belongs to you.
We will never log your usage, and all logging capabilities of the engine have been disabled. Only basic metrics are permitted.
While our SearXNG powered engine may not offer you as personalized results as Google might, we cannot generate a profile about you, and profit off your usage.
What you search for should be inherently private. Culpur.net doesn’t care about what you search for, and Culpur will never shares anything with a third-party, and it can’t be used to compromise you.
If you do care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, or otherwise believe in digital freedom, consider making Culpur your go to a protect your searches online.
