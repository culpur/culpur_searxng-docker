# About search.culpur.net

search.culpur.net is a is a [metasearch engine], aggregating the results of other
{{link('search engines', 'preferences')}} while not storing information about
its users.

## Why use it?

- search.culpur.net may not offer you as personalized results as Google, but it doesn't
  generate a profile about you.
- search.culpur.net doesn't care about what you search for, never shares anything with a
  third-party, and it can't be used to compromise you.
- search.culpur.net is free software, the code is 100% open, and everyone is welcome to
  make it better.

If you do care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, or otherwise believe
in digital freedom, make search.culpur.net your default search engine or run it on your
own server!


## How do I set it as the default search engine?

search.culpur.net supports [OpenSearch].  For more information on changing your default
search engine, see your browser's documentation:

- [Firefox]
- [Microsoft Edge] - Behind the link, you will also find some useful instructions
  for Chrome and Safari.
- [Chromium]-based browsers only add websites that the user navigates to without
  a path.


## How does it work?

search.culpur.net is a fork from the well-known [searx] [metasearch engine] which was
inspired by the [Seeks project].  It provides basic privacy by mixing your
queries with searches on other platforms without storing search data.  SearXNG
can be added to your browser's search bar; moreover, it can be set as the
default search engine.

The {{link('stats page', 'stats')}} contains some useful anonymous usage
statistics about the engines used.
